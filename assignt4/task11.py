#11. Write a program which uses map() and filter() to make a list whose elements are squares of even
#numbers in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
#Hints: Use filter() to filter even elements of the given listUse map() to generate a list of squares of the
#numbers in the filtered list. Use lambda() to define anonymous functions.
num = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
eve_num = map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda   x: x%2==0, num))
print(list(eve_num))
