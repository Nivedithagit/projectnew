#2. Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and
#their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
#Let’s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.
#HINT - Use Zip function also
#Sample input: students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
#Expected output: {‘Smit’ : ’CSE’ , ’Jaya’ : ’Networking’ , ’Rayyan’ : ’Operating System’}


students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan']
subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']

zipped = zip(students, subjects) 
s=dict(zipped)
print(s)
